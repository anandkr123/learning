hello heaven to you. i am a changed version of abcfile
It was a laser fiber that had broken inside the patient while 
being operated on by another surgeon 18 years prior.
 It had been left to form a stone and caused endless infections.

After the surgery, I informed the patient as to 
what I had discovered- he knew right away who
 the surgeon had been.

I want to add some changes by state branch itself.

It is very sad to have your kidney damaged and your 
life affected because of a bad surgeon who didnâ€™t
 have the appropriate ethical guidelines.

He could have referred the patient to someone else 
so the problem could be fixed before the damage became permanent.
